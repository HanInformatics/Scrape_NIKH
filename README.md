# Scrape_NIKH

This project aims to scrape data from National Institute of Korean History(http://www.history.go.kr/)
In particular, we collect text data from http://db.history.go.kr/ which were already digitised there. 

If you make use of this, feel free to use and don't forget to cite this github site.
